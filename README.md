## Main stuff
### Academics
  * I am a physics and mathematics double major
  at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics            | Math                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| High-energy theory | The Langlands program   |
| String Theory      | Combinatorial geometry  |

  * I am especially interested in how to
    to apply (very) pure math to physics.
### Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day)
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu
  * Reading about quantitative finance

## Teaching 
I have authored, and will author (**many** more)
learning resources; I do this because I enjoy it,
and because I like the clarity about a subject
that teaching it gives me. There are not many
finished handouts out right now, so [https://github.com/will-lancer/handouts/blob/main/School/Laplace_transforms.pdf](here)
is one that I made for my Differential
Equations with Linear Algebra class
([https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/MAT308](MAT 308);
it's on Laplace transforms.
