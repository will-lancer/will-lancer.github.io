# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a Junior in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university
    (graduating May 2027).
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Quantum Field Theory      | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |
| Cosmology                 | Algebraic geometry                |

  * I am mainly interested in quantum field theory, specifically its non-perturbative
    and on-shell formulations. I think these vectors are useful ones for answering
    some of the biggest problems in physics today. I also think cosmology is one
    of the most exciting frontiers in physics right now, and I am very fascinated at the prospect
    of dark matter and dark energy. I also have interests in pure mathematics,
    and I think modern physics will require new and more advanced mathematical
    techniques for its implementation. Specifically, the Geometric Langlands program
    in physics is interesting to me, although I have very little knowledge about it.

### What I'm doing right now

My Fall 2025 course schedule is:
 * QFT 2
 * Group theory for theoretical physics (PHY 680, taught by Peter van Nieuwenhuizen)
 * Graduate algebra 1
 * Physics research with Zohar Komargodski.

My physics research is currently in condensed matter theory and quantum field theory.

Some books that I'm reading now:

For courses:
 * Srednicki's *Quantum Field Theory*. A very solid and clear book on QFT.
   Nice and modern, focusing on the path integral and including modern topics
   like spinor-helicity and many interesting gauges. Nice problems too--not too hard
   but not too easy. IMO, its exposition does occasionally lack, though; he does
   not use enough words at times. However, this is both a pro and a con of this book, so
   I guess one needs to just pick his or her poison.
 * Schwart'z *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model*. This is the book my QFT II
   mostly follows. I read it against my will. Kidding (kind of). I think Schwartz has useful discussions
   of some things, but this book isn't really to my tastes. I will not vent my frustrations
   here, but I morally disgree with Schwartz on how physics (and writing physics
   textbooks) should be done. For example, I am a purist about indices of any kind--Schwartz...
   isn't. While this example is a bit on the trivial side, I think anyone that has flipped
   through the book knows what I'm talking about.
 * Xi Yin's [lecture notes](https://sites.google.com/view/xi-yin/qft-notes) on QFT. Prof. Yin has YouTube lectures online from when he taught
   the class, which are a necessary supplement to these notes. These notes are the best QFT
   resource I've come across--they are the most "morally correct" way of presenting the material
   that I've seen. The best way to describe this class is as a more pedagogical, clear, modern,
   and mathematically precise version of Weinberg. I treasure these notes so much that I'm getting
   them bound into a book for Christmas. **Remark:** one can find problem sets if they look hard
   enough...

 * Andre Lukas' [notes](https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AndreLukas/GroupsandRepresentations/groupsrepslecturenotes.pdf)
   on group and representation theory. These notes are very nice, and I use them in tandem with
   PvN's group theory course. They mostly follow Fulton and Harris, but translate out much of
   the rigor to be amenable to a physicists taste (well, he's an M-theorist, so practically a
   mathematician. But still.) I think the general theory of these notes is a useful supplement
   to the immense and unrelenting detail of PvN's notes.
 * Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*. I'm reading this for graudate algebra I. I believe Aluffi
   is going to be the new graduate standard. His writing is very clear, there are tons of
   interesting exercises, and everything is covered with sights set on further mathematics.
   He covers everything categorically, which is actually quite helpful once you get the hang
   of it. An overall great graduate algebra textbook with an algebraic geometry flavor.

For fun/in my free time:
 * Bryan Gin-ge Chen et. al's *Quantum Field Theory: Lectures of Sidney Coleman*. This
    book is a transcription of Colemans's legendary quantum field theory course that
    he taught for decades at Harvard. It is a wonderful book, chock-full of physical
    insight and witty jokes from one of the best quantum field theorists of all time.
    It's really quite fun to read; I read it everyday while eating breakfast
 * Robert Littlejohn's [Quantum Mechanics](https://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/2122/221.html) course.
    Littlejohn has utterly perfected the presentation of graduate
    quantum mechanics after teaching Berkeley's grad QM course for 30 years straight.
    His notes and lectures are absolute works of art. I watch his lectures when I eat
    lunch.
    
## Industry
For industry, I'm almost exclusively interested in the prospect
of using AI to solve problems. I also think using AI to speed up 
scientific research in the near future will be revolutionary.

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com))
  * Reading
  * Listening to podcasts
  * Writing
  * Talking with my girlfriend (future wife)

## Writing and notes
I will post my notes here as I make them. My note-taking process is
as follows:
  * I do not take notes when I'm reading or listening to something.
    I just think really hard about what I'm learning and organize things
    in my head. To help things along, I will oftentimes pace
    around or talk to myself, or I'll just stare off into space
    for a while.
  * I then make a mind-map of this content. This is to refine and
    encode my understanding of something, as well as to store it for
    later.
  * I free-recall content all of the time. I constantly have some physics
    problem in my "RAM", or my working memory, and I'll just constantly
    be thinking about what I learned recently. I also have dedicated free-recall
    sessions; these take place before I learn my next batch of content. For example,
    if I read a chapter of a book one day, the next day I will free-recall the content
    before I continue learning the next chapter of the book.

**Note:** this is what works for me--it is not a recommendation for you reading this.
I have come to this process through a *tremendous* amount of trial and error. 
I have tried innumerable note-taking techniques, and this hand-crafted method works best for me.
I think it plays to my unique strengths and preferences, like all customized learning systems should. 
If you're making a learning system for yourself,
try a lot of stuff and unapologetically do what works. Every person is such a unique snowflake
of a human being that I think you really just have to try stuff and see what sticks.
There are general recommendations to follow from learning science (e.g. you need to think 
hard, you shouldn't write a lot, etc.), but there is a wide variance in what works for people.
