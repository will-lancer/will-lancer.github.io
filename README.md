# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a freshman [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php)
    and [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) double major at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Algebraic number theory |

  * I am especially interested in how to
    to apply (very) pure math to physics.

### Future coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)
 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics
 * PHY 308: Quantum Mechanics
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis

### What I'm currently reading (updated 3/31/24)

Both of these subjects are on recommendation
of [Warren Siegel](http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~siegel/plan.html).
The sections marked with a [$] are the books I like
the most.

### Physics

**Classical Mechanics**
  * [$] *Modern Classical Mechanics* by Helliwell and Sahakian
  * *Mechanics* by Landau and Lifshitz

**Classical Field Theory**
  * *Classical Field Theory* by Soper
  * [$] *Classical Covariant Fields* by Burgess
  * *Classical Field Theory* by Nastase
  * [$] *Introduction to the Classical Theory of Particles and Fields* by Kosyakov

### Math

**Linear Algebra**
 * *Linear Algebra Done Right* by Axler
 * *Abstract Linear Algebra* by Curtis

**Number Theory**
 * *A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory* by Rosen and Ireland

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day)
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu
  * Reading about quantitative finance

## Teaching 
I have authored, and will author (**many** more)
learning resources; I do this because I enjoy it,
and because I like the clarity about a subject
that teaching it gives me. There are not many
finished handouts out right now, but <a href="/Handouts/School/MAT308_Laplace.pdf"> here </a>
is one that I made for my Differential
Equations with Linear Algebra class
[MAT 308](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/MAT308);
it's on Laplace transforms.
(Any feedback is greatly appreciated
and welcome; if you see *any* mistakes
at all, please contact me with them).

<a href="/Handouts/Physics/Mock.pdf">
    Here
</a> is the mock.
