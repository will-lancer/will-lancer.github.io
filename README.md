# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a sophomore in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics. I am also quite
    interested in Nima-Arkani Hamed's scattering amplitudes program.

### What I'm doing right now
I'm mostly focused on trying to understand quantum field theory right now,
as I'm taking QFT 1 under [Alexander Zamolodchikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zamolodchikov) this spring semester.
I'm also doing a lot of electrodynamics (Jackson my love), 
as I'm taking graduate classical electrodynamics as well.
Research-wise, I'm apart of the ATLAS group at SBU,
under the direction of professor [Hannah Arnold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-arnold-71406a26/).
We study ways to improve the efficiency of c-tagging algorithms.

My next semester course schedule is planned to be:
 * QFT 2
 * String theory 1
 * Grad stat mech
 * Grad algebra 1 (algebra 1 as a junior in university... 💔)
 * Research (theory and experiment)

## Industry
My main interests in industry are:
 * Economical nuclear fission, and commercial nuclear fusion.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying high-level artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, defense, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights.
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com)).
  * Learning other languages (currently Mandarin; I
    use [Lingq](https://www.lingq.com/en/) as my main resource).

## Writing
I will post writings here as I make them. Some
ideas I'm playing around with for the future are:
  * Advice for undergrad (targeted towards math/physics/CS majors)
  * A physics version of [the Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html) by Evan Chen
  * A graduate version of Kevin Zhou's [handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#teaching).
    (Maybe; I'm pretty busy, so what's more likely to occur is a list of hard, informational,
    and interesting problems in graduate level physics, with full solutions by myself. I will
    probably also add useful ideas needed to solve the problems in the list as well, so it'll
    be some sort of pseudo-handout. We'll see what happens).
