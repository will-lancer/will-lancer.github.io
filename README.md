# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a sophomore in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics.
  * I am also quite interested in Nima-Arkani Hamed's
    scattering amplitudes program; it seems like one
    of the only modern hep-th programs that is actually
    treating spacetime as emergent, and that is very enticing
    to me.

### Current coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)

 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics.
 * PHY 511: Graduate Quantum Mechanics I (audit).
 * PHY 335: Electronics and Experimentation Lab.
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I.
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis.
 * CSE 114: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming.
 * PHY 447: Tutorial in Advanced Topics (A reading course on Georgi's
   *Lie Algebras in Particle Physics* under
   [Martin Rocek](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/people/_profiles/rocekm)).

## Industry
My main interests in industry are:
 * Economical nuclear fission, and commercial nuclear fusion.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying high-level artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights.
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com)).
  * Learning other languages (currently French; I
    use [Lingq](https://www.lingq.com/en/) as my main resource).

## Writing
I will post writings here as I make them. Some
ideas I'm playing around with for the future are:
  * Advice for undergrad (targeted towards math/physics/CS majors)
  * A physics version of [the Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html) by Evan Chen
  * A graduate version of Kevin Zhou's [handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#teaching).
    (Maybe; I'm pretty busy, so what's more likely to occur is a list of hard, informational,
    and interesting problems in graduate level physics, with full solutions by myself. I will
    probably also add useful ideas needed to solve the problems in the list as well, so it'll
    be some sort of pseudo-handout. We'll see what happens).
