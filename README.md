# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a freshman [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php)
    and [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) double major at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |

  * I am especially interested in how to make quantum
    field theory rigorous.

### Future coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)
I'm doing one of the required labs my first semester, as my patience
for labs will surely undergo an exponential decay as
time goes on, and I learn more theory.
 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics
 * PHY 335: Electronics and Experimentation Lab
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis
 * MAT 313: Abstract Algebra

### What I'm currently reading (updated 3/31/24)

I am learning the four mechanics (四大力学) at an undergraduate level right
now.

### Physics

**Classical Mechanics**
  * [$] *Modern Classical Mechanics* by Helliwell and Sahakian
  * *Mechanics* by Landau and Lifshitz

**Electromagnetism**
  * [$] *Introduction to Electrodynamics* by Griffiths.

**Quantum Mechanics**
  * *The Physics of Quantum Mechanics* by Binney and Skinner

**Statistical Physics**
  * *Concepts in Thermal Physics* by Blundell^2

### Math

I'm learning basic math right now, like algebra, analysis, and topology.

**Algebra**
 * [$] *Algebra* by Artin
 * [$] *Undegraduate Algebra* by Lang

**Analysis**
 * [$] *Real Mathematical Analysis* by Pugh

**Topology**
 * [$] *Topology* by Munkres.

## Industry
My main interests in business are:
 * Economical nuclear fission
 * Quantitative finance
 * The prospect of AGI; applying artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day)
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu
  * Reading about quantitative finance

## Teaching 
I have authored, and will author (**many** more)
learning resources; I do this because I enjoy it,
and because I like the clarity about a subject
that teaching it gives me. There are not many
finished handouts out right now, but <a href="/Handouts/School/MAT308_Laplace.pdf"> here </a>
is one that I made for my Differential
Equations with Linear Algebra class
[MAT 308](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/MAT308);
it's on Laplace transforms.
(Any feedback is greatly appreciated
and welcome; if you see *any* mistakes
at all, please contact me with them).
