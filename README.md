# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a rising sophomore in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php)
    and [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Biophysics                | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics (number
    theory in physics? We'll see...).
  * I am also quite interested in *making predictions*; I see
    few physicists in the field of hep-th making predictions
    (not for lack of trying, of course!). However, since there
    is evidence of certain groups doing so (e.g. Nima Arkani-Hamed
    and a number of people in dark matter), I think it's a reasonable
    goal.

### Future coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)
I'm doing one of the required labs my first semester, as my patience
for labs will surely undergo an exponential decay as
time goes on. I'm also doing one core physics
graduate course and one core math graduate course,
in addition to some other more basic undergraduate
courses.

 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics.
 * MAT 534: Graduate Algebra I.
 * PHY 335: Electronics and Experimentation Lab.
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I.
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis.

### What I'm currently reading (updated 7/2/24)
I'm basically just prepping for my graduate courses next semester,
in addition to some topical reading on PDEs and QM.
 * For classical mechanics, I'm finishing up *Modern Classical Mechanics* by
   Helliwell and Sahakian, as well as *Mechanics* by Landau and Lifshitz.
 * For algebra, I'm going through Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*, and Lang's
   *Undergraduate Algebra*. The latter is a far more classical and digestible
   treatment of algebra, and the former gives one a more modern perspective
   on the subjectl; they complement each other nicely.
 * I'm also reading some E&M; mainly Purcell and Griffiths,
   with supplementary reading from Lechner's book *Classical
   Electrodynamics: A Modern Perspective*.

## Industry
My main interests in business are:
 * Economical nuclear fission, and commercial nuclear fusion.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying high-level artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day; ATG all day.)
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com)).
  * Reading about quantitative finance; the two books I'm leisurely reading
    right now are *Quantitative Risk and Portfolio Management:
    Theory and Practice* by Winston and *A First Course in Quantitative Finance* by Mazzoni.
  * Learning Mandarin Chinese (I use LingQ, tons of comprehensible
    input from YouTube, and Anki).

## Notes
I will post my notes here as I make them. Note (tehe)
that I take notes in a different way than most; I use
mind-maps to learn content, and then make LaTeX notes to 
store problem-solving strategies and interesting
facts (aka things that I might forget after not seeing
a subject for a while). Coming by the end of Fall 2024
are:
   * Classical mechanics; notes and mind-map.
   * Electromagnetism; notes and mind-map.
   * Algebra; notes and mind-map.
   * Quantum; notes and mind-map

### Book recommendations
Here are some book recommendations for physics and math.
Note that the physics recommendations are a tailored towards
those that have very strong foundational physics backgrounds
(i.e. from the physics olympiad. The background I roughly expect
would be that of [Kevin Zhou's handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#teaching).) 
If you don't have this background, then the first thing I'd do is *get it*;
going through the handouts covers the first ~2 years
of undergraduate at top colleges, and the first 3 years
at many others (including Stony Brook, actually).
Anything labeled with a "+" at the end of it means
that it's not necessary, but if you want to go to
"the next level", that's the thing I'd recommend.
These are often more mathematical, and useful for
those aiming towards theoretical high-energy physics
(at least, I'd think so; I haven't "made it" in hep-th yet).
Things marked with a "-" are the opposite: usually a
bit easier than the book after it, but still very
worth reading.
