# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a rising sophomore in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php)
    and [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |

  * I am especially interested in extending the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and the challenge of making parts of QFT rigorous.

### Future coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)
I'm doing one of the required labs my first semester, as my patience
for labs will surely undergo an exponential decay as
time goes on. I'm planning on doing one core physics
graduate course and one core math graduate course,
in addition to some other more basic undergraduate
courses.

 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics.
 * MAT 534: Graduate Algebra I.
 * PHY 335: Electronics and Experimentation Lab.
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I.
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis.

### What I'm currently reading (updated 6/4/24)
I'm basically just prepping for my graduate courses next semester,
in addition to some topical reading on PDEs and QM.
 * For classical mechanics, I'm going through *Modern Classical Mechanics* by
   Helliwell and Sahakian.
 * For algebra, I'm going through Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*.
 * For fun (and because I'm taking PDEs this summer), I'm going through
   Pivato's *Linear Partial Differential Equations and Fourier Theory*
   and a few quantum mechanics textbooks: Zwiebach's, Woit's, and Binney and Skinner's.

## Industry
My main interests in business are:
 * Economical nuclear fission.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, etc.).

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day).
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
  * Reading about quantitative finance.
  * Learning Mandarin Chinese.

## Teaching 
I will author some handouts and general teaching materials in
the future, and will post them here for free.

### Coming soon
Here are some planned projects:
 * A "graduate version" of Kevin Zhou's [handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#teaching);
   I want to cover the four main mechanics, then most likely QFT after that.
 * Some handouts on mathematics for physics. Topics that are likely to be covered
   are multivariable calculus, linear algebra, ODEs, and (the basics of) PDEs.
