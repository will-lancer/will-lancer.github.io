# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a rising sophomore in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php)
    and [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Biophysics                | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics (number
    theory in physics? We'll see...).

### Future coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)
I'm doing one of the required labs my first semester, as my patience
for labs will surely undergo an exponential decay as
time goes on. I'm also doing one core physics
graduate course and one core math graduate course,
in addition to some other more basic undergraduate
courses.

 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics.
 * MAT 534: Graduate Algebra I.
 * PHY 335: Electronics and Experimentation Lab.
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I.
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis.

### What I'm currently reading (updated 6/10/24)
I'm basically just prepping for my graduate courses next semester,
in addition to some topical reading on PDEs and QM.
 * For classical mechanics, I'm finishing up *Modern Classical Mechanics* by
   Helliwell and Sahakian.
 * For algebra, I'm going through Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0* (best algebra book ever!).
 * For fun (and because I'm taking PDEs this summer), I'm going through
   Pivato's *Linear Partial Differential Equations and Fourier Theory*
   and a few quantum mechanics textbooks: Zwiebach's, Woit's, and Binney and Skinner's.
   Most of my focus is on classical mechanics and algebra, though.

## Industry
My main interests in business are:
 * Economical nuclear fission, and commercial nuclear fusion.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying high-level artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day; ATG all day.)
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com)).
  * Reading about quantitative finance.
  * Learning Mandarin Chinese.

## Teaching 
I will author some handouts and general teaching materials in
the future, and will post them here for free.

### Planned materials
Here are some planned projects:
 * A "graduate version" of Kevin Zhou's [handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#teaching);
   I want to cover the four main mechanics, then most likely QFT after that.
   Of course, I have to *learn* all of this stuff at the graduate level first (actually,
   past the graduate level if I want to make the handouts good);
   this is something I will probably accomplish around the end of my
   Sophomore year, so look here around then for the beginnings of
   the handouts.
 * Some handouts on mathematics for physics. Topics that are likely to be covered
   are multivariable calculus, linear algebra, ODEs, and (the basics of) PDEs.

## Notes
I will post my notes here as I make them. Note (tehe)
that I take notes in a different way than most; I use
mind-maps to learn content, and then make LaTeX notes to 
store problem-solving strategies and interesting
facts (aka things that I might forget after not seeing
a subject for a while). Coming by the end of Fall 2024
are:
   * Classical mechanics; notes and mind-map.
   * Electromagnetism; notes and mind-map.
   * Algebra; notes and mind-map.
   * Quantum; notes and mind-map
The classical mechanics and algebra notes and mind-maps
are going to be graduate level, while the electromagnetism
and quantum are most likely going to be at the
upper-undergraduate/lower-graduate level.
