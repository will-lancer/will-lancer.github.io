# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a rising sophomore in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php)
    and [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |

  * I am especially interested in extending the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and the challenge of making parts of QFT rigorous.

### Future coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)
I'm doing one of the required labs my first semester, as my patience
for labs will surely undergo an exponential decay as
time goes on. I'm also planning on doing two core
graduate physics courses; classical mechanics, and statistical
mechanics. In addition to that, I'm doing some basic
undergraduate physics and mathematics courses.

 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics.
 * PHY 540: Graduate Statistical Mechanics.
 * PHY 335: Electronics and Experimentation Lab.
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I.
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis.
 * MAT 313: Abstract Algebra.

### What I'm currently reading (updated 3/31/24)

I am learning the four mechanics (四大力学) at an undergraduate level right
now.

### Physics

**Classical Mechanics**
  * *Modern Classical Mechanics* by Helliwell and Sahakian.
  * *Mechanics* by Landau and Lifshitz.

**Electromagnetism**
  * *Introduction to Electrodynamics* by Griffiths.

**Quantum Mechanics**
  * *The Physics of Quantum Mechanics* by Binney and Skinner.

**Statistical Physics**
  * *Concepts in Thermal Physics* by Blundell^2.

### Math

I'm learning basic math right now, like algebra, analysis, and topology.

**Algebra**
 * *Algebra: Chapter 0* by Aluffi.
 * *Undegraduate Algebra* by Lang.

**Analysis**
 * *Real Mathematical Analysis* by Pugh.

**Topology**
 * *Topology* by Munkres.

## Industry
My main interests in business are:
 * Economical nuclear fission.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, etc.).

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day).
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
  * Reading about quantitative finance.
  * Learning Mandarin Chinese.

## Teaching 
I will author some handouts and general teaching materials in
the future, and will post them here for free.

### Coming soon
Here are some planned projects:
 * A "graduate version" of Kevin Zhou's [handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#teaching);
   I want to cover the four main mechanics, then most likely QFT after that.
 * Some handouts on mathematics for physics. Topics that are likely to be covered
   are multivariable calculus, linear algebra, ODEs, and (the basics of) PDEs.
