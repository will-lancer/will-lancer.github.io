# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a rising Junior in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university
    (graduating May 2027).
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics. I am also quite
    interested in Nima-Arkani Hamed's scattering amplitudes program.

### What I'm doing right now

This summer, I'm going to be doing a few main things:
 * (Most central item) A research project with Hannah Arnold to implement the
   SALT framework in studying leptonic decays of ttH(->cc).
 * QFT. Zamolodchikov's course is very unique, mostly focusing on
   the renormalization group and related topics. After about 1.5 months
   we only did renormalization. So I need to learn all of the standard
   QFT 1 stuff, e.g. QED and whatnot before I take QFT 2, as it's all assumed.
 * Math. I want to make my foundation in basic math (algebra, topology, analysis)
   stronger; I've taken some classes in them, but I don't have the same freedom thinking
   about math as I do with physics. So I will be spending some time working on these
   subjects this summer. This material is also *foundational* for the hep-th and math
   research I'd like to do.

For these learning goals, I'll be going through the following courses.
I'll be posting my work as I go for posterity.
 * Finishing up PHY 610, as taught by Alexander Zamolodchikov in Spring 2025.
 * [Physics 253a](https://sites.google.com/view/xi-yin/qft-notes) by Xi Yin, as taught in Fall 2022.
 * Math [55a](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/137344/assignments/syllabus) and
   [55b](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/143404/assignments/syllabus) by Denis Auroux,
   as taught in Fall 2024-Spring 2025.
I'll be working through Math 55 the whole summer,
and 253a only once I've finished 610. I'll be doing
all of the homeworks, and I'll also share my notes here
once they're done.

My next semester course schedule is:
 * QFT 2
 * Group theory for theoretical physics (PHY 680, as taught by Peter van Nieuwenhuizen)
 * Grad stat mech
 * Algebraic topology 
 * Research (theory and/or experiment)

## Industry
My main interests in industry are:
 * Economical nuclear fission, and commercial nuclear fusion.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying high-level artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, defense, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights.
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com)).
  * Learning other languages (currently Mandarin; I
    use [Lingq](https://www.lingq.com/en/) as my main resource).

## Writing
I will post writings here as I make them. Some
ideas I'm playing around with for the future are:
  * Advice for undergrad (targeted towards math/physics/CS majors)
  * A physics version of [the Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html) by Evan Chen

As I don't have much time these days, my only semi-finished writing is my
handout on index notation. You may find it [here]([Expository/Math/IndexNotationpt2.pdf](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will-lancer/handouts/main/Expository/Math/IndexNotationpt2.pdf&embedded=true)).
Please let me know if you have any comments, big or small.
