# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a rising sophomore in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php)
    and [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university.
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Biophysics                | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics (number
    theory in physics? We'll see...).
  * I am also quite interested in *making predictions*; I see
    few physicists in the field of hep-th making predictions
    (not for lack of trying, of course!). However, since there
    is evidence of certain groups doing so (e.g. Nima Arkani-Hamed
    and a number of people in dark matter), I think it's a reasonable
    goal.

### Future coursework (Fall 2024, Sophomore year)
I'm doing one of the required labs my first semester, as my patience
for labs will surely undergo an exponential decay as
time goes on. I'm also doing taking two core
graduate phyics courses,
in addition to some other more basic undergraduate
ones.

 * PHY 501: Graduate Classical Mechanics.
 * PHY 540: Graduate Statistical Mechanics.
 * PHY 335: Electronics and Experimentation Lab.
 * PHY 301: Electromagnetic Theory I.
 * MAT 320: Introduction to Analysis.

## Industry
My main interests in business are:
 * Economical nuclear fission, and commercial nuclear fusion.
 * Quantitative finance.
 * The prospect of AGI; applying high-level artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights (especially leg day; ATG all day.)
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com)).
  * Reading about quantitative finance; the two books I'm leisurely reading
    right now are *Quantitative Risk and Portfolio Management:
    Theory and Practice* by Winston and *A First Course in Quantitative Finance* by Mazzoni.
  * Learning Mandarin Chinese (I use LingQ, tons of comprehensible
    input from YouTube, and Anki).

## Notes
I will post my notes here as I make them. Note (tehe)
that I take notes in a different way than most; I use
mind-maps to learn content and organize my thoughts, 
and then make LaTeX notes to  make "mini-courses" for myself.
Coming by the end of Fall 2024 are:
   * Classical mechanics; notes and mind-map.
   * Electromagnetism; notes and mind-map.
   * Statistical mechanics; notes and mind-map.
   * Quantum mechanics; notes and mind-map.
   * Algebra; notes and mind-map.
   * Analysis; notes and mind-map.
