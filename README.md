# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a Junior in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university
    (graduating May 2026).
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Quantum Field Theory      | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |
| Cosmology                 | Algebraic geometry                |

  * I am mainly interested in quantum field theory, specifically its non-perturbative
    and on-shell formulations. I think these vectors are useful ones for solving
    some of the biggest problems in physics today. I also think cosmology is one
    of the most exciting frontiers in physics right now, and I am very fascinated at the prospect
    of dark matter and dark energy.
  * I also have interests in pure mathematics,
    and I think modern physics will require new and more advanced mathematical
    techniques for its implementation. Specifically, the Geometric Langlands program
    in physics is interesting to me, although I have very little knowledge about it as of now.
    The work with the positive Grassmannian a la Nima Arkani-Hamed also seems quite
    interesting.

### What I'm doing right now
Building a start-up.

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com))
  * Reading
  * Listening to podcasts
  * Writing
  * Talking with my girlfriend

## Writing and notes

### Mind-maps
Here are some of my mind-maps. A few remarks:
   * I take lecture notes via mind-maps as well. If you see
     scattered tiny maps that's probably what those are.
   * My current understanding of the subject should have a big
     purple oval around it with a title like "Current map" or something.
   * These aren't meant to be learned from--I just want to share
     what good physics/math mind-maps look like to hopefully expose
     people to the efficacy of this learning methodology.

Coming soon (after I figure out how to put giant mind-maps on GitHub).

### Random remarks on learning and note-taking
My note-taking process is as follows:
  * I skim through whatever I'm reading and broadly organize the content
    in a mind-map before I go deep into the material; this is one of the hardest
    parts of the studying process, but well worth it.
  * I then read the resource. I will occasionally add certain things
    to my mind-map at this time, but most of this reading is just reading
    with no note-taking--the hard part (knowing how to think about the material)
    was already done.
  * I continue reading the resource until it's time to rework my entire understanding
    of the subject, then I rewrite my mind-map. This happens a few times when learning
    anything; you make massive jumps in understanding whenever you do this, and it's quite
    fun to change the way you think about something.
  * I free-recall content all of the time. I usually will have some physics
    problem in my "RAM", or my working memory, and I'll think about it when I have
    free time. I also have dedicated free-recall
    sessions; these take place before I learn my next batch of content. For example,
    if I read a chapter of a book one day, the next day I will free-recall the content
    before I continue learning the next chapter of the book.

**Note:** this is what works for me--it is not a recommendation for you reading this.
I have come to this process through a *tremendous* amount of trial and error.
If you're making a learning system for yourself,
try a lot of stuff and unapologetically do what works. Every person is such a unique snowflake
of a human being that I think you really just have to try stuff and see what sticks.
There are general recommendations to follow from learning science (e.g. you need to think 
hard, you shouldn't write a lot, etc.), but there is a wide variance in what works for people.
I do have a few recommendations, though:
  * Try to do "higher-order learning"; I think Bloom's revised taxonomy is
    solid. It's not the Bible--just a decent recommendation.
  * Don't write so much. Writing is just a tool to help you think. Thinking
    is what matters for learning. Don't trick yourself into believing that
    writing = learning. In fact, the *worst* students I've seen write the *most*.
    It's laughable and kind of depressing to see people make this error;
    please abstain from it.
  * Try mind-mapping. I know, I know, it's super trendy and cringe, but seriously:
    try it. It's seriously effective, and is built to activate
    higher-order learning processes. Warning: like anything, it's a skill that you
    develop. I think it probably took me around 20 mind-maps to start
    getting good at them. However, if you build this skill, I genuinely think
    you can 100x your learning.
