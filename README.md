# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a Junior in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university
    (graduating May 2027).
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics. I am also dually
    interested in solving *physical* problems: the Hierarchy problem,
    the problem of the cosmological constant, three generations of matter,
    etc. As far as current research goes, Nima-Arkani Hamed's scattering amplitudes program
    is the most interesting frontier I see, and I intend on working on it.

### What I'm doing right now

My Fall 2025 course schedule is:
 * QFT 2
 * Group theory for theoretical physics (PHY 680, taught by Peter van Nieuwenhuizen)
 * Graduate algebra 1
 * Physidcs research with Zohar Komargodski.

My physics research is currently in condensed matter theory.

### What I'm thinking about

I'm thinking about whether or not to take a gap year to
go all in on AI and start-ups. I see almost zero downside
to this, and a potentially massive upside. We will see, though.
I like physics research a lot, so I need to think about things more.

## Industry
For industry, I'm almost exclusively interested in the prospect
of using AI to solve problems.

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Running
  * Lifting weights
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com))
  * Reading
  * Listening to podcasts
  * Writing
  * Talking with my girlfriend

## Writing and notes
I will post writings here as I make them. Some
ideas I'm playing around with for the future are:
  * Advice for undergrad (targeted towards math/physics/CS majors)
  * My notes and mind-maps that I've made in my undergrad.
    Most people don't really think about the notes they
    take, so I would like to show mine as a positive example.

As I don't have much time these days, my only semi-finished writing is my
handout on index notation. You may find it [here]([Expository/Math/IndexNotationpt2.pdf](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will-lancer/handouts/main/Expository/Math/IndexNotationpt2.pdf&embedded=true)).
Please let me know if you have any comments, big or small.
