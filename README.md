# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a rising Junior in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university
    (graduating May 2027).
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Beyond the Standard Model | The geometric Langlands program   |
| String Theory             | Quantum field theory              |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |

  * I am especially interested in working on the mathematics of quantum
    field theory, and in exploring the connections between
    the Landlands program and theoretical physics. I am also dually
    interested in solving *physical* problems: the Hierarchy problem,
    the problem of the cosmological constant, three generations of matter,
    etc. As far as current research goes, Nima-Arkani Hamed's scattering amplitudes program
    is the most interesting frontier I see, and I intend on working on it.

### What I'm doing right now

This summer, I'm going to be doing a few main things:
 * (Most central item) A research project with Hannah Arnold to implement the
   SALT framework in studying leptonic decays of ttH(->cc).
 * QFT. Zamolodchikov's course is very unique, mostly focusing on
   the renormalization group and related topics. After about 1.5 months
   we only did renormalization. So I need to learn all of the standard
   QFT 1 stuff, e.g. QED and whatnot before I take QFT 2, as it's all assumed.
 * Math. Some of my research interests are highly mathematical, and will
   require strong grasps of modern mathematics. As such, I need to start
   going through this learning process. I'm starting with algebra, as
   I find the idea of algebraic geometry incredibly exciting.

For these learning goals, I'll be going through the following courses/books.
 * [Physics 253a](https://sites.google.com/view/xi-yin/qft-notes) by Xi Yin, as taught in Fall 2022.
   This will be supplemented with Coleman's QFT book, as well as Yin's 253b course.
 * Paolo Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*.

My next semester course schedule is:
 * QFT 2
 * Group theory for theoretical physics (PHY 680, as taught by Peter van Nieuwenhuizen)
 * Grad topology
 * A reading course in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry
 * Physics research with Zohar Komargodski

## Industry
My main interests in industry are:
 * Economical nuclear fission, and commercial nuclear fusion
 * Quantitative finance
 * The prospect of AGI; applying high-level artificial intelligence
   to specific industries (finance, energy efficiency,
   customer service, defense, etc.)

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Running (I am training for an ultra-marathon right now)
  * Lifting weights
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com))
  * Reading
  * Talking with my girlfriend

## Writing and notes
I will post writings here as I make them. Some
ideas I'm playing around with for the future are:
  * Advice for undergrad (targeted towards math/physics/CS majors)
  * My notes and mind-maps that I've made in my undergrad.
    Most people don't really think about the notes they
    take, so I would like to show mine as a positive example.

As I don't have much time these days, my only semi-finished writing is my
handout on index notation. You may find it [here]([Expository/Math/IndexNotationpt2.pdf](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will-lancer/handouts/main/Expository/Math/IndexNotationpt2.pdf&embedded=true)).
Please let me know if you have any comments, big or small.
