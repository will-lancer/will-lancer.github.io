# Main stuff
## Academics
  * I am a Junior in [physics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) and
    [mathematics](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook university
    (graduating May 2026).
  * My research interests are:

| Physics                   | Math                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Quantum Field Theory      | The Geometric Langlands program   |
| Scattering Amplitudes     | The Langlands program             |
| Cosmology                 | Algebraic geometry                |

  * I am mainly interested in quantum field theory, specifically its non-perturbative
    and on-shell formulations. I think these vectors are useful ones for solving
    some of the biggest problems in physics today. I also think cosmology is one
    of the most exciting frontiers in physics right now, and I am very fascinated at the prospect
    of dark matter and dark energy.
  * I also have interests in pure mathematics,
    and I think modern physics will require new and more advanced mathematical
    techniques for its implementation. Specifically, the Geometric Langlands program
    in physics is interesting to me, although I have very little knowledge about it as of now.
    The work with the positive Grassmannian a la Nima Arkani-Hamed also seems quite
    interesting.

### What I'm doing right now

My Fall 2025 course schedule is:
 * QFT 2
 * Group theory for theoretical physics (PHY 680, taught by Peter van Nieuwenhuizen)
 * Graduate algebra 1
 * Physics research with Zohar Komargodski.

My physics research is currently in condensed matter theory and quantum field theory.

Some books that I'm reading now:

For courses:
 * Schwart'z *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model*. This is the book my QFT II
   mostly follows. I read it against my will. Kidding (kind of). I think Schwartz has useful discussions
   of some things, but this book isn't really to my tastes. I will not vent my frustrations
   here, but I morally disgree with Schwartz on how physics (and writing physics
   textbooks) should be done. For example, I am a purist about index placement---Schwartz...
   isn't. I think anyone that has flipped through the book knows what I'm talking about.
   It is a solid textbook with a good selection of topics, but it's not a textbook that I
   am eager to read.
 * Xi Yin's [lecture notes](https://sites.google.com/view/xi-yin/qft-notes) on QFT. Prof. Yin has YouTube lectures online from when he taught
   the class, which are a necessary supplement to these notes. These notes are the best QFT
   resource I've come across---they contain the most "morally correct" way of presenting the material
   that I've seen. The best way to describe these notes is as a more pedagogical, clear, modern,
   and mathematically precise version of Weinberg. I treasure these notes so much that I'm getting
   them bound into a book for Christmas. The main shortcoming of these notes is that you don't get enough
   computational practice from them---my personal theory is that computation comes naturally to Xi and so
   he doesn't emphasize it as much. One needs to supplement with Srednicki or Schwartz for more "standard"
   computational practice. **Remark:** one can find problem sets if they look hard
   enough...

 * Andre Lukas' [notes](https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AndreLukas/GroupsandRepresentations/groupsrepslecturenotes.pdf)
   on group and representation theory. These notes are solid, and I use them in tandem with
   PvN's group theory course. They mostly follow Fulton and Harris, but translate out much of
   the rigor to be amenable to a physicists taste (well, he's an M-theorist, so practically a
   mathematician. But still.) I think the general theory of these notes is a useful supplement
   to the immense and unrelenting detail of PvN's notes. However, a serious downside of these
   notes is that they are relatively terse--many non-trivial claims are just stated. His usage
   of vectors having upper indices and covectors having lower indices is also abnormal, and makes
   a number of his formulas look weird.
 * Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*. I'm reading this for graduate algebra I. I believe Aluffi
   is going to be the new graduate standard. His writing is very clear, there are tons of
   interesting exercises, and everything is covered with sights set on further mathematics
   (usually algebraic geometry). He covers everything categorically, which is actually quite helpful once you get the hang
   of it. An overall great graduate algebra textbook with an algebraic geometry flavor.

For fun/in my free time:
 * Bryan Gin-ge Chen et. al's *Quantum Field Theory: Lectures of Sidney Coleman*. This
    book is a transcription of Colemans's legendary quantum field theory course that
    he taught for decades at Harvard. It is a wonderful book, chock-full of physical
    insight and witty jokes from one of the best quantum field theorists of all time.
    It's really quite fun to read.
 * Robert Littlejohn's [Quantum Mechanics](https://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/2122/221.html) course.
    Littlejohn has utterly perfected the presentation of graduate
    quantum mechanics after teaching Berkeley's grad QM course for 30 years straight.
    His notes and lectures are absolute works of art.
    
## Industry
For industry, I'm almost exclusively interested in the prospect
of using AI to solve problems. I also think using AI to speed up 
scientific research in the near future will be revolutionary.

## Hobbies
Outside of physics and math, I enjoy,
  * Lifting weights
  * Brazilian jiu-jitsu (I train at [Vanguard Academy](https://www.vanguardjj.com))
  * Reading
  * Listening to podcasts
  * Writing
  * Talking with my girlfriend (future wife)

## Writing and notes

### Mind-maps
Here are some of my mind-maps. A few remarks:
   * I take lecture notes via mind-maps as well. If you see
     scattered tiny maps that's probably what those are.
   * My current understanding of the subject should have a big
     purple oval around it with a title like "Current map" or something.
   * These aren't meant to be learned from--I just want to share
     what good physics/math mind-maps look like to hopefully expose
     people to the efficacy of this learning methodology.

Current maps:
  * Group theory for physics. (Coming right after I figure out how to put
    a giant mind-map on my GitHub)
     

### Random remarks on learning and note-taking
My note-taking process is as follows:
  * I skim through whatever I'm reading and broadly organize the content
    in a mind-map before I go deep into the material; this is one of the hardest
    parts of the studying process, but well worth it.
  * I then read the resource. I will occasionally add certain things
    to my mind-map at this time, but most of this reading is just reading
    with no note-taking--the hard part (knowing how to think about the material)
    was already done.
  * I continue reading the resource until it's time to rework my entire understanding
    of the subject, then I rewrite my mind-map. This happens a few times when learning
    anything; you make massive jumps in understanding whenever you do this, and it's quite
    fun to change the way you think about something.
  * I free-recall content all of the time. I usually will have some physics
    problem in my "RAM", or my working memory, and I'll think about it when I have
    free time. I also have dedicated free-recall
    sessions; these take place before I learn my next batch of content. For example,
    if I read a chapter of a book one day, the next day I will free-recall the content
    before I continue learning the next chapter of the book.

**Note:** this is what works for me--it is not a recommendation for you reading this.
I have come to this process through a *tremendous* amount of trial and error.
If you're making a learning system for yourself,
try a lot of stuff and unapologetically do what works. Every person is such a unique snowflake
of a human being that I think you really just have to try stuff and see what sticks.
There are general recommendations to follow from learning science (e.g. you need to think 
hard, you shouldn't write a lot, etc.), but there is a wide variance in what works for people.
I do have a few recommendations, though:
  * Try to do "higher-order learning"; I think Bloom's revised taxonomy is
    solid. It's not the Bible--just a decent recommendation.
  * Don't write so much. Writing is just a tool to help you think. Thinking
    is what matters for learning. Don't trick yourself into believing that
    writing = learning. In fact, the *worst* students I've seen write the *most*.
    It's laughable and kind of depressing to see people make this error;
    please abstain from it.
  * Try mind-mapping. I know, I know, it's super trendy and cringe, but seriously:
    try it. It's seriously effective, and is built to activate
    higher-order learning processes. Warning: like anything, it's a skill that you
    develop. I think it probably took me around 20 mind-maps to start
    getting good at them. However, if you build this skill, I genuinely think
    you can 100x your learning.
